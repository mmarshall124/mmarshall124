# Hi I'm Matthew Marshall, welcome to my Github page! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as a software developer for Penn East Federal Credit Union. The majority of my work is with large data manipulation and presentation using SQL, Python, and Java.

## Interests
I'm passionate about data science and scientific programming! Many of my projects are based around different machine learning methods including Neural Networks,
Random Forest Regression, and Monte Carlo Methods. I currently run a (very work in progress) [dev blog](https://datadrops.dev) where I hope to talk about some of the projects I'm working on
right now!


Stepping out of the data world a little bit, I'm very interested in procedural generation projects, I've done some game development including a [1-month game jam](https://github.com/mmarshall124/Recipe-for-love),
and I've dabbled with test applications on the Algorand blockchain.

In college I was involved with a couple of scientific research projects and I'd love to be able to contribute to the scientific community again!
